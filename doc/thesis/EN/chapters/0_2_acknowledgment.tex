Additionally, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all the teachers of the School of Information and Communications Technology - Hanoi University of Science and Technology for the dedicated lessons and invaluable knowledge they imparted. They have been essential in providing me with a solid foundation to carry out this graduation project and will undoubtedly be beneficial in my future career path.

Additionally, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to my family and friends for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout this journey. Their belief in me bolstered my determination and motivated me to strive for excellence.

Last but not least, I acknowledge my own efforts and perseverance in overcoming challenges and achieving the goals I set for this project. This experience has been a testament to the power of hard work and dedication.
