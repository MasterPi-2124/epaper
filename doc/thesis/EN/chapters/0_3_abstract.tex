This thesis delves into the development and implementation of an innovative information board system using ePaper technology, addressing the need for an energy-efficient and sustainable alternative to conventional digital signage. Traditional solutions, predominantly LED or LCD-based displays, are widely used but grapple with challenges like high power consumption and poor readability in bright light. Despite considerable advancements in digital signage, there exists a gap in achieving a solution that is both eco-friendly and efficient in varied lighting conditions.

Responding to these challenges, the project's approach pivots on leveraging ePaper technology, known for its low power usage and excellent visibility under different lighting. This technology is particularly suited for diverse environments such as schools, hospitals, offices, and marketplaces. A significant part of this thesis is dedicated to developing a comprehensive management system that facilitates seamless content updates across multiple ePaper displays. This system is designed to be intuitive and robust, offering real-time content management and display customization.
